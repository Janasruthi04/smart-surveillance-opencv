#Smart Surveillance Detection System using OpenCV üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüì∑

#Description:
The Smart Surveillance Detection System is a powerful real-time motion detection application built using OpenCV. It continuously monitors a video feed (webcam or video file), identifies motion using background subtraction and contour detection, and captures timestamped snapshots whenever motion is detected. This helps in maintaining security and surveillance effectively.

#Features:
‚Ä¢	Real-time motion detection using background subtraction.
‚Ä¢	Contour detection to filter significant motion.
‚Ä¢	Automatic snapshot saving with timestamps for event review.
‚Ä¢	Easy to deploy on any camera feed.

#How to Use:
1.	Run the application using your webcam or a video file.
2.	The system displays the live video feed with motion overlays.
3.	Snapshots of detected motion events are saved in the output/ folder.
4.	Review snapshots for security monitoring.

#Technologies Used:
‚Ä¢	Python for core logic.
‚Ä¢	OpenCV for image processing.
‚Ä¢	NumPy for efficient array handling.

#Future Enhancements:
‚Ä¢	Email/SMS alerts for motion events.
‚Ä¢	Object classification to differentiate humans from pets or vehicles.
‚Ä¢	Integration with cloud storage for remote monitoring.
