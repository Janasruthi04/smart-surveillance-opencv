# smart-surveillance-opencv
Developed a motion-based surveillance system using OpenCV, implementing background subtraction, contour detection, and automated snapshot capture for real-time monitoring. Enhanced security through timestamped image saving and robust motion detection, achieving an estimated accuracy of 90% in detecting motion events.
